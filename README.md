# War Card Game Simulation

A simple simulation of the card game WAR displayed through the console log. This was made as my Promineo Tech assignment for week 6 of the course.

Like real War, each player is randomly dealt 26 cards from a deck of 52. They then play the cards in order with points being awarded to who has the higher value of card. Notably, this project does not yet include the acutal War mechanical, as that was excluded from the assignment's directions. Ties simply result in no points for either side, though I plan to change that when I have the chance.
